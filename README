This script generates stitched-together screenshots of Android Wear UIs that
are too tall to fit on the screen all at once. It does by taking a screenshot,
scrolling a bit, taking another screenshot etc. until it reaches the bottom
of the screen. It then does some image processing to merge the screenshots
that were taken.

This works with real devices and with emulated watches.

Usage:

./wear_screenshot_stitch.py [--square] [--transparency] [--adb-args ...]

    --square                assume device has a square screen
                            (otherwise a circular screen will be assumed)

    --transparency          use alpha transparency for pixels around the corners
                            of the output that the circular screen chops off

    --adb-args              any arguments following this will passed to
                            adb directly
